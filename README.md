# Array Problem Solutions

This repository contains Python solutions to common array problems, along with explanations for how the solutions work.

## Cycling Array

**Description:**

The "Cycling Array" solution rotates the elements of an array to the left by one position.

**How it Works:**

1. The last element of the array is stored in a variable called `last_el`.

2. A loop iterates over the array in reverse order, shifting elements to the left.

3. The value stored in `last_el` is placed at the first position of the array.

## Reversing Array
**Description:**

The "Reversing Array" solution reverses the order of elements in an array.

**How it Works:**

The solution takes an array A, along with the start and end indices.

A while loop swaps elements at start and end, moving towards the center of the array.
